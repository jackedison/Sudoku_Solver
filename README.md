# EXTENSIONS OVER A BASIC SUDUKO SOLVER
 1. This code will find **all** possible solutions of the puzzle. It will not stop after finding the first solution.
 2. Allows for solution to more complex sudokus (anti chess constraints, diagonal constraints, etc.)


# Suggested future extensions
1. Additional constraints. Due to OOP nature of this code these can be easily added with a new method to the Advanced_Sudoku_Solver() class.
